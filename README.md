droenbot is a crappy node.js discord bot and you probably shouldn't use it.

but if you want to use it, all you have to do is create a `config.json` file with a discord API key. 

ex. `config.json` file:
`{
	"token": "YOUR_DISCORD_API_KEY", 
	"prefix": "!",
}`

if you want to make more commands just stick 'em in the commands folder.

to call the command in discord, just type `!command_name.js`. you can change the prefix in the `config.json` file.
